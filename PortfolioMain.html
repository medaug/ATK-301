			<h2> Welcome!</h2>
			<p> Hi there! Thanks for checking out my portfolio page. My name is Meaghan Daugherty and I am currently a sophomore student at Illinois State University. Majoring in Creative Technology, I have had the pleasure of studying in classes such as Web Design and Sound Design. This portfolio page was created by me and I would love for you to check out my stuff! In my projects tab, I have some examples of things I have been working on in the past 2 years that I've studied at Illinois State. I have HTML and CSS experience using Atom and Github that allowed me to create my own portfolio. I also have sound design experience using Adobe Audition and GarageBand. I personally have really enjoyed the work that these courses have brought me, and cannot wait to use the things that I have learned when I graduate. </p>
			<p> I hope to pursue a career in Web Development or a career within the Music Industry. I have studied music business and love all things art related. I think it would be an amzing opportunity to be able to make a living doing something I am truly passionate about.<p>
			<p> Thank you so much for checking out my page! For any additional contact information or questions, please visit the "Other" page at the top of the screen. </p>
